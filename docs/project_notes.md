# Progress Notes

## Initial Setup

Day 0
- **Tasks**: Initialized project with PlatformIO, set up GitHub repository, linked local folder.
- **Challenges**: Resolved branch mismatch (master/main), handled non-fast-forward push.
- **Next Steps**: Look through Arduino Docs, become familiar with components, begin building

Day 1
- **Tasks**: Familiarize yourself with components (potentiometer, stepper motor)
- **Challenges**: Learning proper breadboarding (connections, safety)
- **Next Steps**: Order extra male-female dupont wires to test/connect stepper motor

Day 2
- **Tasks**: Connect and test stepper motor
- **Challenges**: 
  * <u>Figuring out if Arduino 5V PSU could properly power the stepper motor:</u> noticed that the rated voltage on the motor itself says "5V DC"; might want to supply it with more voltage if I think about altering the weight of a specific load 
  * <u>Learning Stepper built-in library functions to make the motor rotate:</u> step() and setSpeed() (their uses are explained in respective README code blocks)
  * <u>Debugging stepper motor not wanting to turn counter-clockwise:</u>
- **Next Steps**:
