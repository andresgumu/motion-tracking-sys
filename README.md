# pid-motor-control-sys
Develop a closed-loop position control system for a stepper motor to achieve precise angular positioning with &lt;1Â° accuracy using a PID control algorithm and encoder feedback. The project demonstrates expertise in classic control systems, C++ programming, closed-loop control, and real-time feedback, tailored for hardware engineering applications.
